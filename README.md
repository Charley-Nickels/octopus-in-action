# Octopus In Action — Alpha v1.152g-b HOTFIX (Playable)

This **HOTFIX** bakes visible sprites and a playable loop so we can verify the deploy and controls quickly:
- WASD/Arrows to move the Mayor
- NPC idle wandering
- Clear tiles (water/grass/path)
- HUD buttons (Start/Pause)
- Slower time

Once verified live, we'll swap these placeholders with your real V1 sheets via the manifest mapping.
