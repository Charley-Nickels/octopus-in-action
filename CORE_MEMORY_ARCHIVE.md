- Satirical take on civic bureaucracy, NPC moods, and procedural life
- Inspired by *Animal Crossing*, *Stardew Valley*, and *Papers, Please*

Example – Task Resolution:
```
if task.inProgress and currentHour in businessHours:
    task.progress += 1
    if task.progress >= task.requiredHours:
        task.complete()
```
